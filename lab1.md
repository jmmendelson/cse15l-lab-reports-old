* To install VSCode, I searched for it online and downloaded it from code.visualstudiocode.com. When it was done downloading, I opened it and it told me how to proceed.

**Remotely connnecting**
* To remotely connect, I typed *ssh* into the terminal followed by the email used for my account. I pressed enter, typed yes, then pressed enter again. 
  Finally, I typed my password and pressed enter to gain access to the computer remotely. This last step is the one shown in the image.
